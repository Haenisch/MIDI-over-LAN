            objective: Resume the worker process.

            objective: Set the list of MIDI input ports to be sent.
            data: list of tuples (active, device_name, network_name)

        SET_MIDI_OUTPUT_PORTS:
            objective: Set the list of MIDI output ports to be processed.
            data: list of tuples (network_name, device_name)

        SET_NETWORK_INTERFACE:
            objective: Set the network interface for sending multicast packets.

            objective: If enabled, save CPU time with the trade-off of a higher latency.

        - The set of MIDI input ports is a list of tuples, where each tuple
            contains the actual device name and its user-defined network name as
            well as a flag indicating whether the port is active. With each call
            of SET_MIDI_INPUT_PORTS, the internal list of MIDI input ports is
            replaced.

        - The set of MIDI output ports is a list of tuples, where each tuple
            contains the network name (MIDI input ports from the network) and
            the local MIDI output port name to which the input port is bind
            (i.e., to which the MIDI messages should be sent). With each call of
            SET_MIDI_OUTPUT_PORTS, the internal list of MIDI output ports is
            replaced.
