            objective: Stop the worker process.
            data: None

        SET_MIDI_INPUT_PORTS:
            objective: Set the list of MIDI input ports to be sent.
            data: list of tuples (active, device_name, network_name)

        SET_MIDI_OUTPUT_PORTS:
            objective: Set the list of MIDI output ports to be processed.
            data: list of tuples (network_name, device_name)

        SET_NETWORK_INTERFACE:
            objective: Set the network interface for sending multicast packets.
            data: str (IPv4 address or hostname); "" or None for the default interface

        SET_ENABLE_LOOPBACK_INTERFACE:
            objective: Enable or disable the loopback interface.
            data: bool

        SET_IGNORE_MIDI_CLOCK:
            objective: Ignore or process MIDI clock messages.
            data: bool

        SET_SAVE_CPU_TIME:
            objective: If enabled, save CPU time with the trade-off of a higher latency.
            data: bool
    
    Note:
    
        - The set of MIDI input ports is a list of tuples, where each tuple
          contains the actual device name and its user-defined network name as
          well as a flag indicating whether the port is active. With each call
          of SET_MIDI_INPUT_PORTS, the internal list of MIDI input ports is
          replaced.

        - The set of MIDI output ports is a list of tuples, where each tuple
          contains the network name (MIDI input ports from the network) and
          the local MIDI output port name to which the input port is bind
          (i.e., to which the MIDI messages should be sent). With each call of
          SET_MIDI_OUTPUT_PORTS, the internal list of MIDI output ports is
          replaced.
        
        - If the network interface is set to an empty string or None, the
          default network interface is used. Each time the interface is set,
          the previous interface is closed and the new interface is opened.
