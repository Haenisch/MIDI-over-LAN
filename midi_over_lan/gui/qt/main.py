"""MIDI over LAN GUI client.

The GUI client is a simple "MIDI over LAN" application that allows you to select
the local MIDI ports that you want to send over the network and the remote MIDI
ports that you want to bind to your local MIDI ports. The remote MIDI ports are
provided by other MIDI over LAN applications running on the same network and
automatically discovered by the GUI client.
"""

# The GUI is implemented using PySide6. The wirdgets/dialogs are created using
# Qt Designer and the generated code is used in the application.
#
# There are two worker processes that run in the background:
#
#     1. The sender process sends MIDI messages over the network to the listening
#        hosts.
#
#     2. The receiver process receives MIDI messages from the network and sends
#        them to the specified local MIDI output ports.
#
# The sender and receiver processes are implemented using the multiprocessing
# library. The entire communication between the sender and receiver processes is
# done using the multiprocessing.Queue class. For possible commands and results,
# see the documentation of the sender and receiver classes and the
# worker_messages.py module, respectively.
#
# Logging is done using the standard Python logging module. The log messages
# are sent to a log queue, which is processed in a separate thread, thus allowing
# the worker processes to log messages much quicker and to reduce the latency.
