    """Command enumeration.

    Available commands:

        RESTART:
            objective:  Restart the worker process.
                 data:  None
        PAUSE
            objective:  Pause the worker process.
                 data:  None

        RESUME:
            objective:  Resume the worker process.
                 data:  None

        STOP:
            objective:  Stop the worker process.
                 data:  None

        SET_MIDI_INPUT_PORTS:
            objective:  Set the list of MIDI input ports to be sent.
                 data:  list of tuples (input port name, network name)

        SET_MIDI_OUTPUT_PORTS:
            objective:  Set the list of MIDI output ports to be bound.
                 data:  list of tuples (network name, output port name)

        SET_NETWORK_INTERFACE:
            objective:  Set the network interface to be used in the worker
                        processes.
                 data:  str or None. See below for more information.

        SET_ENABLE_LOOPBACK_INTERFACE:
            objective:  Enable or disable the loopback interface.
                 data:  bool

        SET_IGNORE_MIDI_CLOCK:
            objective:  Ignore MIDI clock messages (if data is set to True).
                 data:  bool

        SET_SAVE_CPU_TIME:
            objective:  If enabled, save CPU time with the trade-off of a higher
                        latency.
                 data:  bool

    Note:
    
        - The set of MIDI input ports is a list of tuples, where each tuple
          contains the actual MIDI input port name as well as its user-defined
          network name. With each call of SET_MIDI_INPUT_PORTS, the internal
          list of MIDI input ports is replaced.

        - The set of MIDI output ports is a list of tuples, where each tuple
          contains the network name (remote MIDI device) and the local MIDI
          output port name to which the input port is bound (i.e., to which the
          MIDI messages should be sent). With each call of
          SET_MIDI_OUTPUT_PORTS, the internal list of MIDI output ports is
          replaced.

        - The network interface must be a valid IPv4 address in dot-decimal
          notation. The receiving worker process may also receive a None value
          for the network interface. In this case, the worker process binds to
          all available network interfaces.

class Information(Enum):

    Available commands:

            objective:  Provide information about the recently sent hello packet.
                        The hello packet has been created by the sending worker
                        process and has been sent to the network.

                        packet (received from the network by the receiving
                        worker process). The information is passed to the

                        the local host and the various remote hosts. The round
                        trip time is the time between sending a hello packet and
                        receiving the corresponding hello reply packet.
